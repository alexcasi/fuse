# fuse - serialization primitives

fuse is a modular and customizable library which provides simple binary serialization.

fuse has built-in support for serializing
Boost.Fusion [forward sequences](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/fusion/doc/html/fusion/sequence/concepts/forward_sequence.html)
and Hana [structs](http://boostorg.github.io/hana/group__group-Struct.html), as well as a bunch of custom types.

## Features

* Concepts
* Adapters for Boost.Fusion sequences and Hana structs
* Binary serialization

## Building

fuse is header-only by default.
However, it can also be built in a separate compilation unit.

## Library dependencies:

* Boost 1.46.0+

## Documentation
The documentation can be found at http://timniederhausen.github.io/fuse.
The URL above points at a copy of this repositories' `gh-pages` branch,
which contains the entire self-contained HTML documentation.

Additionally, the documentation can be generated by building the special
`fuse.doc` target. Note that this target is only available if you have
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) installed.

## Acknowledgements

fuse is inspired by Thomas Rodgers' presentation
[Implementing wire protocols with Boost Fusion](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014/tree/master/Presentations/Implementing%20wire%20protocols%20with%20Boost%20Fusion).

There's also a blog post describing everything more detailed [here](http://rodgert.github.io/2014/09/09/type-driven-wire-protocols-with-boost-fusion-pt1)
